# ðŸ“„ License

LexiorFlow is released under a dual license: MIT and proprietary license for certain features. The original project is licensed under the MIT License. See the [LICENSE](LICENSE) file for details.

### Key Changes
1. **Project Name**: Changed from "Langflow" to "LexiorFlow."
2. **Focus Area**: Updated to focus on the legal domain.
3. **License Section**: Updated to indicate the dual licensing model.

### Setting Up Dual Licensing
To implement dual licensing:
1. **Retain the Original MIT License**:
   - Keep the `LICENSE` file with the original MIT License text.
   - Acknowledge the original Langflow project and its contributors.

2. **Add Your Own License**:
   - Create a `LICENSE_proprietary.txt` or similar file.
   - Specify that certain features or modules of LexiorFlow are licensed under a proprietary license.
   - Clarify in the README and documentation which parts are covered by the proprietary license and which are under MIT.

3. **Include a Licensing Notice**:
   - Add a clear notice at the beginning of your README.md and in relevant code files to indicate the dual licensing model.
   - Example:
     ```markdown
     ## Licensing
     LexiorFlow is dual-licensed under the MIT License for the core framework and a proprietary license for advanced features related to the legal domain. For more information, see the LICENSE files in this repository.
     ```

Following these steps will help you legally and clearly adapt the project while introducing a dual licensing model.
